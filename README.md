Modified_Implementation.ipynb is the correct file to use when testing my final implementation. For loading this .ipynb, go to Google Colab home > file > Open Notebook > "GitHub" on left option bar, then enter the following link under where it says "Enter a GitHub URL": https://github.com/bobbydodge1/ds340w/blob/main/Modified_Implementation.ipynb 
Next, click the search icon, then select 'Modified_Implementation.ipynb'

The dataset use in my final implementation is DS340ProjectDataset.csv. The link to it is already pre-loaded in Modified_Implementation.ipynb.

These are the only two files you will need.
